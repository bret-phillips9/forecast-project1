Project to solve a take-home assignment from a real data science technical interview.

Here are the instructions from the company.  It was originally provided as a Word file, but I have extracted the text of it here, to hide the company's identity.

## Sample Data Set: 
This test is to assess your approach to data analysis and problem solving. We have attached a sample time series data set which has a total of 10 features. There is one and a half year of data (2016-01-01 to 2017-07-01) sampled at 5 minutes. The Y features are the target variables and the X features are the independent variables. 

(The dataset name is dataset_for_technical_assessment.csv.  It contains 157,812 observations and 11 features.  It is included in the repo.)

## Your task is to:
1.	Clean and pre-process the data
2.	Summarize the data 
3.	Find anomalies in the target variables (Y1 , Y2). Explain your method and your findings
4.	Forecast the Y variables for next 14 days (2017-07-02 to 2017-07-15). You should focus on improving accuracy of your predictions 
5.	Create a detailed report with plots and explanation of the analysis youâ€™ve done
6.	Submit both the report and the code

## Note
You are free to choose any combination of variables, or even do PCA from the given data set. You are free to resample the data. You are free to use any machine learning models or statistical models or toolboxes. Please note that you must explain your methods and your decisions in the report. You can use either python or R.

(My solution is containted in an R Markdown file, forecast_solution.Rmd.  This allows you to run the code by chunk and to knit the final result into an HTML file.)

## Time
4 (four) days.  
(I left this in here to show the typical amount of time allotted for this type of assignment.)
